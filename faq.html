          <strong>IMPORTANT: </strong> Sologenic is currently running on
          <strong>SIMULATOR</strong> mode and therefore all transactions must
          take place on the <strong>TESTNET</strong> XRP Ledger.

      <h2>Trust Lines</h2>
      <br />
      <h5>What’s a Trustline?</h5>
      <p>
        A “Trustline” is a relationship between the tokenized asset holder (you)
        and the issuer of the tokenized asset (Sologenic). It’s essential for
        users to establish this relationship in order to be able to withdraw
        their tokenized assets and trade on the XRP Ledger Decentralized
        Exchange.<br />
        In a nutshell, Trustlines are simply a two-way link between the
        Blockchain user and Sologenic.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h5>Why are Trustlines required?</h5>
      <p>
        Trustlines enable Sologenic users to conduct transactions in the XRP
        Ledger where they can trade fractions of their assets 24/7 with other
        Blockchain users. By having a Trustline, users become eligible to
        receive possible dividends for their assets on the Blockchain.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h5>How to set a Trustline?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>
          To establish a Trustline you are required to hold a minimum of 5 XRP
          as a reserve for each Trustline in your external XRP wallet. Once your
          account meets this minimum reserve requirement, simply use one of the
          tools or guides suggested in the instructions to establish the
          Trustline to Sologenic from your external wallet.
        </p>

          </li>

              >Add a Trustline using xrptoolkit.com (Easy)</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <br />

      <h5>How to remove a Trustline?</h5>

      <div>
        <p>
          You can remove any Trustline by simply transferring your assets to
          Sologenic (or another wallet) and proceed to removing the Trustline
          using the guide provided. Once a Trustline is removed, your 5 XRP
          reserve becomes available to you.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="remove-custom-trustline.html"
              >Remove a Trustline Guide (Advanced)</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="remove-xrptoolkit-trustline.html"
              >Remove a Trustline using xrptoolkit.com (Easy)</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <br />

      <h5>How many Trustlines can be established?</h5>
      <p>
        You can establish as many Trustlines as you want with Sologenic.
        Remember, that for each Trustline you need to add 5 XRP to your wallet
        to be used as a reserve.
      </p>

      <h2>Pool Orders</h2>
      <br />
      <h5>What is the pool order?</h5>
      <p>
        It’s a new trading feature on Sologenic. Pool Order will allow you to
        invest in stocks regardless of what the share price is. This means that
        no share is too expensive and makes it easier for you to diversify your
        portfolio. An excellent example of this is when you split a bill with
        your friends at a restaurant. Each of you pulls your money together to
        pay for the bill, the only difference here is that you receive a
        fraction of a tokenized stock depending on how much you have contributed
        to the pool share.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h5>How to buy fractional shares?</h5>
      <p>
        To buy fractional shares, navigate to the Trade section of the Sologenic
        asset tokenization simulator dashboard, select "Pool Order," choose
        which fiat currency or crypto you want to use to purchase the asset, and
        enter the amount you want to buy. Click continue to confirm the
        trade.<br />
        Alternatively you can buy fraction of shares using the DEX.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h5>How to sell fractional shares?</h5>
      <p>
        To sell fractional shares, navigate to the Trade section of the
        Sologenic Tokenization asset simulator dashboard, select “Pool Order”,
        choose which fiat currency or crypto you want to use to sell the asset,
        and enter the amount. Click continue to confirm the trade.<br />

        Alternatively you can sell fraction of shares using the DEX.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h5>How to cancel a pool order?</h5>
      <p>
        To cancel a pool order, click on the “Orders” section on the Sologenic
        Tokenization asset simulator dashboard and press on X in the platform's
        right area.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>Tokenization</h2>
      <br />
      <h5>What is tokenization?</h5>
      <p>
        Tokenization is the process of converting physical (and non-physical)
        assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. The concept has grown
        relatively popular in the blockchain and DeFi space and is beginning to
        inch its way into traditional industries as well. Real estate, artwork,
        stocks – just a shortlist of the assets that companies are beginning to
        tokenize.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>What benefits tokenization has?</h5>
      <div>
        <p>
          Tokenization reveals the potential for a more transparent, efficient
          and fair transactions
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Greater Liquidity</li>
          <li>Faster and cheaper transactions</li>
          <li>Globalized access</li>
          <li>Transparency</li>
          <li>Accessibility</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br />
      <h5>How assets are tokenized?</h5>
      <p>
        The tokenization of assets refers to the process of issuing a blockchain
        token (specifically, a security token) that digitally represents a real
        tradable asset—in many ways similar to the traditional process of
        securitization, with a modern twist. These security tokens can then be
        held on the Sologenic platform, user’s private crypto wallet or traded
        on DEX- decentralized exchange.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h5>How to track and see the tokenized assets in real-time?</h5>
      <p>
        All tokenized assets held on the Sologenic platform are available for
        review under the Portfolio section of the Sologenic platform. In order
        to see actual tokens on the XRP ledger, navigate to the History section
        and switch Tokenizations tab. All tokenizations are available on that
        page, by clicking on “View TX'' button a user can see the proof of his
        asset tokenization on the XRP Ledger explorer.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Deposits and Withdrawals</h2>

        Sologenic Assets -> Scroll down to “Your Tokenized Assets” section and
        press “Deposit Asset”. Note that a Trustline needs to be established
        prior to making deposits of tokenized assets.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h5>How to deposit and withdraw Fiat?</h5>
      <p>
        The “Portfolio” section allows you to easily deposit and withdraw your
        fiat currencies using various payment methods such as wire transfers,
        e-transfers, faster payments, SEPA.

      <h5>What wallets are supported at Sologenic?</h5>
      <p>

      <h2>DEX</h2>
      <br />
      <h5>What is DEX?</h5>
      <p>
        DEX is a fully-functional decentralized exchange built on top of XRP
        Ledger’s where users can trade issued tokenized assets for SOLO or XRP.
        Sologenic is building a simple, intuitive, and powerful UI with the same
        development standards as used within CoinField Centralized Exchange.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h5>How can I trade on DEX?</h5>
      <p>
        Once you have a tokenized asset in your Sologenic account, you can
        withdraw these funds to your personal wallet and trade them on the
        decentralized exchange. To do so, you must first create a Trust-line by
        going to the DEX section.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h5>Who controls the DEX?</h5>
      <p>
        XRP Ledger's DEX is a decentralized exchange that exists on the
        Blockchain. Users have full control over their trades and keys.
      </p>

        Yes, you can trade using your crypto assets that are held on CoinField.
        Please note that your crypto will be automatically converted to the base
        currency of the exchange that you are using. This means that if you
        decide to cancel your trade, you will receive base fiat currency instead
        of your original crypto.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h5>
        When I can expect a refund after cancelling my order(s)? OR. Why am I
        getting fiat after cancelling an order whereas I paid in crypto?
      </h5>
      <p>
        You will receive a refund as soon as you cancel your order, however, if
        you used crypto for your trade, your funds were automatically converted
        to the exchange's base currency with a market order. Thus you will
        receive fiat. If you would like to convert it back to crypto, it is
        possible to transfer fiat to CoinFiled and convert to any supported
        crypto.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Portfolio</h2>

        both your Sologenic Assets and your CoinField asset.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h5>Why are my Crypto assets on CoinField?</h5>
      <p>
        Your cryptocurrency funds are always held in your CoinField wallets, so
        there will be no need to transfer your cryptocurrencies between the
        platforms. When you select a cryptocurrency to trade an asset, such as
        SOLO, your SOLO will be automatically converted, with a market order
        using CoinField’s trading pair, to the base currency of the Stock
        Exchange you are using.
