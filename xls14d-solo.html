        <h5>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)</h5>
        <p>
            A non-fungible token (NFT) is a token on the Blockchain to represent unique items such as art and
            collectibles. Each NFT is unique and has different properties that distinguishes it from other NFTs. Unlike
            cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, NFTs are not interchangeable and are indivisible. And NFT is traded as a
            whole and fractional exchanges such as in other cryptocurrencies are not allowed.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h5>XRP Ledger (XRP)</h5>
        <p>
            The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized, public blockchain led by a global community of developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s fast, energy efficient, and reliable. With ease of development, low transaction costs, and a
            knowledgeable community, it provides developers with a strong open-source foundation for executing on the
            most demanding projects—without hurting the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            XRPL uses a consensus protocol, in which designated servers called validators come to an agreement on the
            order
            and outcome of XRP transactions every 3-5 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            All servers in the network process each transaction according to the same rules, and any transaction that
            follows the protocol is confirmed right away. All transactions are public, with strong cryptography to
            guarantee
            the integrity of the system.</p>
        <p>
            Anyone can operate a validator; currently, over 150 validators are active on the ledger, operated by
            universities, exchanges, businesses, and individuals. Additionally, the consensus protocol ensures the
            blockchain becomes more decentralized over time as the validator pool grows.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h5>XRP Ledger Issued Tokens</h5>
        <div>
            <p>
                The XRP Ledger Blockchain provides a way for any currencies to be issued on the network using IOUs. This
                feature allows users to issue tokens that can be exchanged on the network through transfers or the
                built-in Decentralized Exchange on the XRPL.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the token issuance on the XRP Ledger works really well for issued crypto currencies such as SOLO
                out of the box, it needs to be tweaked to be used for indivisible assets such as NFTs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The XRP Ledger has an issued token precision of 15 significant figures. The smallest amount of an issued
                token the XRPL can handle is 1000000000000000e-96. That means for a token to be indivisible, the issuer
                must only create 1000000000000000e-96 of the token to represent an NFT.
            </p>

        </div>

        <br />

        <h5>XLS-14d</h5>
        <div>
            <p>
                Full details: <a
                    href="https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/30">https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/30</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                The XLS-14d proposal originally by Wietse Wind from the XRP Ledger developer community introduced a set
                of standards to be followed for NFTs issuances.
            </p>
            <p>
                This proposal has been welcomed by the community as a way to issue NFTs on the XRP Ledger, but since the
                underlying technology is not built for NFT use-cases, it lacks some features and makes the overall
                minting a complicated process.
            </p>

        </div>

        <br />


        <h5>XLS-14d/SOLO variation</h5>
        <div>
            <p>
                The SOLO variation of the XLS-14d follows many aspects of the original XLS-14d but tearts an XRP address
                as a “collection” that can hold many NFTs within it.

            </p>

            <p>
                This allows users to mint a collection of NFTs using only 1 account, thus reducing multiple account
                activation fees.

            </p>
            <p>
                Sologenic NFT Marketplace is made up of 2 components. A Backend component that is responsible for
                minting NFTs on user’s behalf, indexing data directly from the ledger and the Frontend, which is
                connected to the ledger and the API data provided by the backend. Together these components make up the
                minting, searching and trading of NFTs.

            </p>

            <h6>Minting Process:</h6>

            <p>
                Each NFT must be minted inside a collection, a collection is an issuer that mints only 1 of each asset
                type, but can hold multiple NFTs.
            </p>
            <p>Minting is done through the NFT workshop section on the Sologenic.org platform. </p>

            <p>
                Each collection has a unique ID, which is the XRPL address of the issuer. E.g.
                rwTw6Bm5AXce4PgDnY7HcdAqkSj6DgUXjq
            </p>

            <p>
                This address has the following metadata:
            </p>

            <pre>{
    "address":"Address of the issuer",
    "minted_by":"Address of the user who minted the nft",
    "colllection_uid":"A unique ID representing this collection within Sologeinc",

  </pre>

            <p>Each minted NFT has a unique currency code with the following format:</p>
            <pre>
                "023031" + HEX(ipfs.cid.substring(0, 5) + "NFT") + "000000000000000000"
            </pre>

            <p>Each NFT has the following metadata that is uploaded to IPFS:
            </p>
            <pre>
{
    "address": "Address of the issuer",
    "minted_by": "Minted by this address",

}
  </pre>

            <p>Once a collection is minted, the transfers NFT IOUs to the minter and blackholes the issuer address.
            </p>
            <p>The following transactions are conducted on the issuer accounts:</p>

            <p>1st TX:

                Upon release of the XLS-20d, Sologenic will allow minters to transfer their collections to the new
